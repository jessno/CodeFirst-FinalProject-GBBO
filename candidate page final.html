                            <h5> Steph</h5>
                            <p class="cposition"> Steph’s grandad got her baking with his love of homemade bread.
                                She’s always loved making a mess in the kitchen, but she has been baking with a
                                vengeance for the past three or so years. She is primarily self-taught
                                and considers herself an ‘intermediate, still-learning’ baker.
                                Steph lives in Chester with her mum, and her passion for sports and wellness inspires her baking:
                                she enjoys the challenge of making her bakes healthier, adding vegetables or fruits,
                                lowering the refined sugar content and prioritising more nutritional fats.
                                Breads are Steph’s go-to bake – she relishes the challenge of creating a better version of a supermarket
                                favourite – but her signature bake is her sourdough loaf using her starter, which she calls ‘Sammy’. </p>

                            <h5>Alice</h5>
                            <p class="cposition">Alice grew up in a riverside town in Essex. At 15 years old, while recovering from a back operation
                                for scoliosis and no longer able to do sport, she turned her hand to baking – and perfected the fruit 
                                pavlova while she was living in New Zealand in her early 20s, where she also attended art school. After
                                returning to the UK, she trained to be a Geography teacher. Now living in East London, she uses cakes in
                                her lessons – demonstrating everything from coastal erosion to volcanic activity. She loves making highly
                                decorative layered cakes for her friends and family. Her baking style 
                                is intricate and delicate, full of flavour and enthusiasm – and has to make people go ‘wow!’</p>

                                <h5>David</h5>
                                <p class="cposition"> David grew up in rural Yorkshire, where his mum (who baked all the time – the family never
                                    ate a shop-bought loaf at home) inspired him to start baking. His passion was further developed by his
                                    travels to Malawi (among other places) with his work as a Health Advisor, where he learnt to build an oven
                                    out of an oil drum and invented a cake that could steam cook over a village fire.
                                    David studied art and design before switching to nursing. When he’s not travelling the world for work,
                                    he lives in London and has lots of hobbies like cycling and ceramics. David’s baking repertoire is broad,
                                    but his strengths lie in bread. He’s not into fancy, colourful icings, but prefers robust flavours and good,
                                    solid bakes.</p>

                                        born to bake. Born in Belgium to an English father and Malaysian–Chinese mother, she grew up in London,
                                        studied in both Bristol and Leeds, and now lives in Leeds with her partner. Her bustling, mixed-heritage
                                        background is reflected in her open attitude to all styles of baking, loving rustic baking just as much as
                                        she loves creating cute bakes with an emphasis on detail. Her baking passion, 
                                        though, is bread – she has turned her hand to pretty much every style and type of bread there is.</p>

Once here, he discovered an abundance of new flavours and cuisines that have inspired his ‘East-meets-West’-style of baking. As a research scientist, Rahul’s instinct is to undertake every bake with a forensic attitude to research and an uncompromising attention to detail. He is fascinated by the science of baking, but also loves to ensure (or at least try) that his creations are beautiful, full of flavour and structurally elegant, too.</p>

                                                dessert at his restaurant. Her family is originally from Bangladesh, where desserts aren’t a big

                                                beautiful masterpieces at family occasions. Born in Luton, she now lives in Leeds with her husband
                                                and is full time mum to their three children. Having put her career on the backburner to devote her
